+-Personality Traits-----------------------------------------------------------+
| Shy and closed to all but a select few, he will not the less unleash his     |
| political views if pushed. Ivor has never been close enough to anyone to have|
| a chance of a romantic relationship                                          |
+-Ideals-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Ivor is basically a leveler. He passionately believes the world order is     |
| unjust and must be torn down and re-made.                                    |
| He fights to stop Tiamat, for the same reason a democratic socialist         |
| campaigns for Biden - first exercise the existing evil, then move onto       |
| reshaping the world.                                                         |
+-Bonds------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Intensely loyal to his sister, who kept him alive through their years on the |
| streets.                                                                     |
+-Flaws------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| A hard life makes Ivor deeply distrustful of new friends. He has no trust of |
| those with authority / power, and his passionionate believes can sometimes   |
| blind him to nuance and compromise                                         |
