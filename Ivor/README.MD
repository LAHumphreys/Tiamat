# The Chronicle of Ivor

## Backstory

### Life Before the Monastery

The youngest son of a successful merchant, Ivor was tutored along with his
elder siblings on the road - as the family flitted between trading hubs. Not
gifted with the natural charm and quick minds of his elder siblings, Ivor
quickly lost interest in the business he was never going to inherit. In its
place came a fascination with the history and myths of the continent. Although
his brothers and sisters all learned many tongues - the only language that Ivor
ever took to was Elvish, delighted by the secrets that this ancient people and
their texts could unlock.

As he moved into young adulthood, Ivor announced his unlikely to study with the
famed chronicler monks at Oak-Tree Abbey. A generous donation from his Father
secured him am place, and at 15 left the family to begin life as a novice.
Quiet, occasionally forgetful, Ivor was not quick to make a name for himself -
and when he choose to specialise in the obscure "Cult of the Dragon", he seemed
destined to be no more than a footnote in the venerable institution's famed
Chronicles.

### A life dedicated to obscure research

For nearly 20 years Ivor meticulously studied his subject in the Oak-Tree
archives. More often than not, when he did venture out to ancient libraries or
rumoured historical sites he would return empty handed - inevitably generating
gentle mockery from his more successful brothers at the Abbey.

## Journey to Greenest

### The unlikely protagonist

With the continent in turmoil, Ivor suddenly finds himself the unlikely centre
of attention at the Abbey. Handed a letter of patent from the head of his
order, Ivor is sent out to learn all he can; before he must return to the
Abbey and lead the effort to Chronicle these unprecedented times.

As the situation continues to deteriorate, it becomes apparent the solitary
traveller will need to overcome his introverted nature and find some
companions if he is to have a chance to live long enough to return and write
his Chronicle. More in hope than expectation, Ivor joins the many travellers
heading for the relative protection of the fortified Trading Town of Greenest

### The road to Greenest
On the road, Ivor fell in with Erin Pride Hammer who's leading a caravan to
the Trading Town. Along the way he meets:
  * Selina - [TODO]
  * Seul a terrifying looking warforged,
  * John, who's half-elven features suggested he was an expert in the longbow he carried over his shoulder
  * Brigid - [TODO]
  * Modar - [TODO]

As the caravan trundled towards Greenest, it became apparent that all was not well. Plumes of smoke towered into the sky,
and when the large buzzard circling the keep turned towards the caravan a jolt of adrenaline shot through Ivor as
realisation dawned. When someone called

> "Thar's no Buzzard - Dragon! RUN!"

he didn't need telling twice. 

[Fortified merchant town - 2 miles out. Plumes of smoke coming from the city. Very large leathering]

### The battle of Greenest

1. Round 1 - RUN!
   * Ignoring Seul who was attempting to shepard the slower civilians away from the road, Ivor joins the dash towards
     the canal, praying that the water would be deep enough to counter dragon fire.
     
   * When he fealt a rush of heat on ths back of his neck, Ivor turned and felt a surge of pity for those who had run
     the other way and were now consumed by the dragon's fiery breath. For the first time he truly understood the
     meaning of the white hot heat he had read so many descriptions of.
    
1. Round 2: Ambush in the canal
   * Reaching the canal, Ivor executed an incrediably ungainly drop into the waterway and he was forced to admit 
     that his trainging master had a point - his "slow drop" could do with some work.
     
   * For the time-being out of sight of the Dragon - Ivor took in his new surroundings. He was standing in roughly 
     2 feet of water the canal was V shaped - with steep banks rising 8 feet on either side.
     > "Watch out - over there on the far bank!"
   * Glancing were Selina pointed, Ivor's heart sank - they had run straight into a trap. On the opposite bank a pair of
     Ambush Lizards were mounted by two trios of Kobolds. With nowhere to take cover, Ivor drew a dart and made ready to
     make a stand.
     
1. Round 3: The Kobolds come undone
    * The first of the lizards advanced on Modar, and made to take a vicious bite at the Rogue. Ivor gave thanks to the
      Gods that the notoriously dim Kobolds and gone for the one member of the party truly at home in the water. As
      Modar elegantly shimmied out of reach the lizard over balanced, throwing one of its riders into 8 feet of Water.
      
    * On reflection he was the lucky one. Still chuckling at his companion splashing about in the water, the second
      Kobald never saw the vicious liquid rush towards him as Seul unleashed his toxic spray
      
    * When the single remaining Kobold turned, exposing his neck, Ivor didn't need a second chance. Launching his dart
      with a practiced hand he took the creature in the throat.
      
    * Now freed from its riders the beast showed little interest in attacking prey that could fight back, and retreated
      back across the canal.

1. Round 4 - Into the City!
    * Behind himm a comic scene was playing itself out. A complex blue light was emanating from Selina's staff, who
      had clearly hypnotised the lead rider of the second Lizard into thinking he was her friend. As his companions
      tried to wrestle control of the beast from him. The fun was abruptly cut short when the Dragon decided that the
      hapless Kobolds were next on the menu.
      
    > Quick! Modar needs help!

    * Cursing, Ivor realised that in the fun he hadn't noticed Modar swimming into the City. He turned and joined
      Selina and Brigid who were already running for the Water gate.
      
1. Round 5 - Skirmish on the Jetty
    * As Ivor climbed out onto the jetty inside the city, he saw a full-scale skirmish taking place. Modar and Brigid
      were attempting to help an isolated squah of city guards fight of a small hoard of Kobolds. Meanwhile, behind
      them 2 roped cult members were begining to cast some form of arcane mischief.
        
    * Not wishing to wait and discover how much magic this young human had, Ivor strode over - drawing his sword with as
      much of a flourish as he could manage. When the unphased cultists continued to cast, swung at the first magician, 
      with his sword.
      
    * The blow was hopelessly wide of the mark - but it was enough to function as a faint and the cultist was quickly
      staggering backwards from the force of Ivor's off-hand punch - his spell harmless firing up into the sky.
        
1. Round 6 - Cleanup
    * As Ivor brought his sword back around and finished off his cultists, he saw the second overcome by yet another
      shot from the Warforged noxious spray gun.   
      
    * Looking around its clear the party now has control of the Jetty
    
## The siege of Greenest

### Aftermarth

Having cleared the jetty, Ivor and his companions made a break for the
keep - where (aided by the chaos the party caused by the Water gate) the remaining city guards have managed to regain
control . A grateful Governor Nighthill instructed a Sargent to find the party a spot to take a breath and recuperate.

Later, as night fell, Ivor stirred from a meditation exercise to find a familiar face waiting patiently for him to emerge from is revery.

> "Leosin! Good to see you safe!"

As the old friends caught up, it quickly became apparent that the Town was still very much in 
serious trouble. Leo has been sent by the governor, who is offering 20 gp a head for anyone who can help with the Town's
plight. The situation was grim:
  * Cultists, Kobolds and even some opportunistic bandits are pouring through the streets
  * There are at least two pockets of trapped civilians:
      * The large temple of Chauntea is being besieged by an organised squad of the cultists
      * A similar group are hold up in the old Town Mill 

With the streets swarming with enemies, not to mention the dragon which was still circling the keep, it was agreed that
any rescue mission would need to use the city catacombs. Without the numbers to save everyone, the party chose to
prioritise the Temple - hoping to find some healers to tend to the many wounded amongst the survivors in the keep.

### Rescue mission to the Temple of Chauntea

The catacombs were cramped, dark, and dank - and the noxious assault on his senses told Ivor that more that at least some of these tunnels were part of the City's sewage system. Initially Ivor had been dubious when Selina had taken out her pipes - but had to admit that the carnivorous rats that infested the tunnels seemed to be giving her a wide berth.

The party emerged from the cellars in a burned out inn outside the temple - to discover a small army attempting to smash the down the doors. Vastly out-numbered it was agreed that Ivor, Modar and John will attempt to scout around the back of the temple. Creeping behind a low stone wall the trio spy a lonely officer smoking a pipe, an impressive looking Scimitar strapped to his waist. As the 3 plan their surprise attack, the young man nonchalantly puts out his pipe, calling out:

> "Are you going to crouch in the rain all day, or are we going to fight?"

Their cover blown, it was apparent this man had to be dealt with quickly before reinforcements could be summoned. 

1. Round 1 - Quick attack against the Lieutenant
   * Before anyone else had a chance to react, Ivor leaped out from cover and takes a swing at the Lieutenant, who easily parried and Ivor had allow his momentum to carry him forward to avoid the counter thrust as he made for the partial cover of the hedgerow across the courtyard.
   
1. Round 2 - Kobalds brewing trouble
   * With John was occupying the officer, Ivor was reaching down to grab a dart when he spied two Kobolds preparing a vial of ominously smoking liquid through the Temple's open upper window.
   * Not wanting to find out what would happen if they managed to get it through the small opening, Ivor strode over and punched the vial out of the small creature's hands.
   * The Kobold turned to the monk in anger, but in the next instant was falling back - one of Modar's arrows protruding from his chest. Too late Ivor realised the danger and he was quickly spluttering from noxious fumes as more of the nasty vials in the Kobald's backpack shattered when it fell backwards.
   
1. Round 3 - Stumble
   * Through the fumes Ivor could see John being set upon by the Scimitar wielding officer. Determined to render aid he staggered towards the fray, only to be overcome by his light-headedness - collapsing to the floor.
   * Ivor's years of training kicked and he quickly sprung to his feet, but when he was struck by a rock from the sling of yet more Kobolds he could start to feel his legs giving out beneath him.
   
1. Round 4 - Rescue
   * Swaying on his feet, Ivor fealt a sudden rush of warm energy flowing into him as Seul laid his hand on the Monk's shoulder.
   * Reinvigorated Ivor picked up his sword and took in the scene. Sensing trouble the rest of the party had arrived and were starting to overwhelm the small group of cultists who'd come to investigate the commotion. Selina was standing over the now unconscious officer.
   * Using his well honed reflexes to step under yet another fire bolt, he executed a darting attack with his short sword against the nearest cultist as the party made quick work of mopping up.
