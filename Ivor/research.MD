# The Prophecy

> There is a prophecy of the five faced beast that will bring about the end of the current age and begin the eternal age of dragons.

# Leosin's final note:

> ‘My friend, this night does not bode well, I doubt if either of us will survive, but I believe it will be you not I whom the gods’ will favour. So I will take this opportunity to apologise for all these years I made you doubt yourself. You were right all along, but the elders saw your ambition and decreed you had to be held back.. We needed more time to see what the cult would do, what their plans were. Your zeal could reveal too much of our own ignorance too quickly, led to a panic, so we hid many, many things from you. Know that you were right that there are parties and persons willingly to stand against the dragons and their designs but that we need time to organise. Head north to Elturel and find the paladin Ontharr Frume, you will find him or his brothers in arms the tavern A Pair of Black Antlers he will be able to guide you forward. Take care and perhaps in another life I can truly make amends for all that I have costed you. Tell Nesim I am sorry and that she was and always will be in my heart. Yours Leosin’

The gauntlet?

Once there was a balance between 3 orgs, between them they protected the world from super-natural threats:
  - Harpers
  - gauntles
  - dragons: Speciality was dealing with ramapaging dragons

# Masks & Cataclyisms

5 masks - one for each head of Tiamat:

   Fire      - 
   Ice       - White mask - dug up in the hideout near greenest
   Acid      - Black - now nurned on the face of Rezmir
   Lightning - 
   Poison    - 

5 cataclysms:
   Acid: The boiling Tradeways of Men (Bolder's get harbour is boiling acid)
   ???:  The Night the Sun Arises (The sun rises at night in Bolder's gate after we rescue the dragon in Tiamat's temple)
   ???:  The Ocean's Edge of Winter
   ???:  The Crystal of the God's Wrath
   ???:  The Blight of flesh, bone and harvest

White, Grey, Blue, Green, Red.

Merged milenia ago, as a way of pulling Tiamat into this realm. 

Taken by the 5 choosen worm speakers of Tiamat. 

The day of the planiar alignment - when Tiamat will be able to traverse through the spaces between the worlds into this world. (Under 300 days)

Destroying one of the masks, the energy would flow into the next world.

Destroy the wearres of the masks. 

555 years is the cycle.
